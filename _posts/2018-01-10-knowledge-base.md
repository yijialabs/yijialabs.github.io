For years in information technology, experts in the field sacrifice valuable
time and energy debugging and fixing database systems.  To change this
situation, we are developing a brand new *knowledge-based&nbsp;system*:
a system that can be an expert itself.

An expert has comprehensive knowledge in some area of expertise. From reliable
advice to the right answer to any question, experts can draw from from a rich
bank of memories&mdash;instant access through years of work and study&mdash;and
almost effortlessly synthesize the right move to make from these memories with
little more than intuition.

For a system to work as an expert, it needs structured data. Tables with
numbers and strings, yes, but also pointers to other objects that in turn
have pointers of their own. To represent these systems, we need an object
model&mdash;an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)),
to borrow the notion from AI literature&mdash;with a rich class structure.

To structure this data in this way envisions a cognitive and trait-based
approach to data and enables a sort of *super&nbsp;memory*, a way to instantly
store and recall facts from not only bare database entries, but also every
intermediate piece of knowledge on the way. This super memory&mdash;to recall
anything in a blink of an eye&mdash;is an major prerequisite to becoming an
expert both as a human being and as the database system we envision.

Our knowledge-based system also needs to know facts, relations, and rules about
its area of expertise, and it needs to hold and use functions on its own to
build new knowledge and information on this area from these sources. This is
what makes our systems truly *knowledge*-based: to be able to create its own
data from an intuition of cognitive functions and relationships.

As mentioned above, our current situation began with knowledge as an entirely
human affair. As databases develop to be able to store more and more information
than ever before, we find ourselves ready to offload routine, knowledge-based
tasks to these databases themselves, and we at YiJia Labs are ready to build
the systems of automated reasoning and knowledge in these databases to do so.
