Experimentation, analysis, study, and play&hellip;here at YiJia Labs, we are
developing a brand new *knowledge database system* to capture the instant
*super&nbsp;memory* and comprehensive knowledge of the IT experts we rely on
everyday.

From domains ranging from specific products to subjects, from any place to any
time, our knowledge databases free our experts from the mundane database
debugging that they have to deal with daily, restoring the time and energy
they need to effect real progress within our lives.
